In this project I implemented an API to manage info about my pernonal projects, that I show in my <a href="https://ronald-portfolio.vercel.app/" target="_blank">portfolio's page</a>.
<br><br>
I build the project using the following technologies:
* ASP.NET Core
* Entity Framework Core
* Cloudinary (to upload screenshots of my projects)

Project under development.
